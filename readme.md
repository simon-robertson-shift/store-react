# reactive-react

A sensible and faster alternative to Redux for JavaScript and TypeScript application state management in the frontend.

This package extends [store](https://github.com/simon-robertson-shift/store) to provide a helpful React hook for monitoring state changes within a component. See the demonstration below.

A package for Vue will be available shortly.

For now, take a look at [store-react-demo](https://github.com/simon-robertson-shift/store-react-demo) for a working NextJS demonstration.

### installation

`npm i @nememo/store-react`
